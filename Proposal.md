/*
My final will be rendering a roaring crowd of people. I'll show the people yelling and cheer and cursing.
There will be a wide range of people in a varity of clothes and different classes.  The people will 
look realistically tall, short, fat, and skiny.  It will be hard, but will be worth it.
*/

/*
Week 1: Collect the phyical images of the people
Week 2: Complete the code for the render of the texture map
Week 3: Position the scale of each person and loop, using the matrix stack. This includes
the viewing angle and projection. 
Week 4: Add motion for the loop of animation to give the illusion of a live crowd
Week 5: Add some special features of sound and expressions
